# WSH Wizards 2 Decade Team

### Using Machine Learning to produce the top wizards players of the past twenty years. 

As I watched the documentary The Last Dance featuring the Chicago Bulls, I anticipated the possibility of the show concluding with Michael Jordan’s final days in the NBA wearing a Wizards jersey. Unfortunately, after falling short to mention his NBA comeback to DC, I was left contemplating : Does anyone remember Michael Jordan playing for the Washington Wizards?

Although his short lived career in a Wizards jersey has been deemed a failure by many, his time in the Nation’s Capital still remains a popular memory for the DC fan base. In addition to a deep dive of the 1998 Chicago Bulls season, the documentary also highlighted many supplemental players who played a role in the franchise winning its 6th championship. Players such as Tony Kucoc, Bill Cartwright, and Scott Burrell were a distant memory until the documentary featured them in the drama filled nationally televised series.
Inspired by the documentary, I decided to look into my own favorite team’s history and relive memories of those who played for the Washington Wizards. With the utilization of machine learning, I generated the two decade dream team consisting of the best players to have played for the Washington Wizards in the past 20 years. 

As I began exploring the dataset two questions quickly surfaced: Who would make this team?, and did the great Michael Jordan do enough in his two year stint to make it? 

Buckle your seatbelts, as the results may surprise you!
