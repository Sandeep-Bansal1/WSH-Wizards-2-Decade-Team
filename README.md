# WSH Wizards 2 Decade Team

 
Throughout  watching the Last Dance, I continuously asked myself the same question: "Does anyone remember Michael Jordan playing for the Washington Wizards?" Although the documentary never displayed him putting on a Wizards jersey, the DC fan base remembers his time in DC all too well. Despite The Last Dance omitting his playing days in DC, the show reminded me of all the great players who played a role in the team winning its 6th Championship.  Players such as Tony Kucoc, Ron Harper, Horrace Grant were much of a distant memory until the dDocumentary reminded viewers who they were and what role each played. 

 	Ultimately, this inspired me to look into my own favorite team's history and relive some of the memories of some of the great athletes who playedplayers to play for the Washington Wizards. By utilizing mMachine lLearning, I generated the Wizards Dream Team of the past 2 decades. **The two questions I aim to answer are: Who isWhose on this team?, and did Michael Jordan do enough in his one year stint to make it? Buckle your seatbelts, as the results may surprise you!**
